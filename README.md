# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a super late introduction to Git, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript that should have been done a very long time ago. 

The purpose of this website is to give an introduction to the skills we will be learning and building upon during this sic month long bootcamp. It is also a good means of checking back to constantly inorove the quality of the website; by adding more html and java information to it over time, as well as improving the aesthetics using css and any other forms of visual improvement, i can continue to use this as a sort of testament of myu growth and acquired knowledge as a new developer. 

This website will help to solve the problem of finding confidence and trust in myself to be able to pull off and complete my own personal projects that I can either look back on for reference for my own personal reasons or for any employers in the future that may want to see a more linear progressiin of my experience as a developer. 

So far I have learned a lot of things that I do not yet quite fully understand such as the function and the math object in javascript, or have forgetten a lot of already such as the css unit that we did two weeks ago at the beginning of our bootcamp, but with a little extra work, and determinatiom, things wil start to become more familiar and make a lot more sense.
