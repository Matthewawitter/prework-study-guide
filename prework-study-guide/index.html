          <li>The head element is not visible to the client or user</li>
          <li>The body element uses h1, h2, h3... h6, to identify specific headers in the body or on the webpage</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS acts as the metaphorical physical style elements of the code when viewed in a web browser such as google </li>
          <li>When you open a live webpage in google you can use the inspect element tool to inspect the different elements of the html and css code</li>
          <li>Can help you understand the viewport; what the website will look like on different devieces and aspect ratios</li>
          <li>Can help to dictate what certain text will do when webpage is shrunken and expanded, shows how to wrap text, what the website should do for certain triggers</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>When you list dimensions its going to apply to the X and Y axes respectively</li>
          <li>You can use hex codes or just use namming semantics to get a desired or specific colour</li>
          <li>Remember to link all your style sheets with your html in the header but at the very bottom of all the meta</li>
          <li>if you specify your classes and your ids, you can manipulate them all at the same time in your style css</li>

          <li>Git is the online cloud based repository that you push and pull your code from</li>
          <li>You can work on code independent from others when you use a branch so that you dont caue conflict with the main branch</li>
          <li>you can send stored code to and inspector before pulling it down into the main branch</li>
          <li>It is important to pull all changes in first before doing any work so that you can stay up to date and code won't conflict</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
